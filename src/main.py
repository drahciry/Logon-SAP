# SAP AUTOMATION SCRIPT
# =============================================================================
#
# Description:
# This script automates the process of logging into multiple SAP systems
# based on data provided in an Excel file. It uses an object-oriented
# approach for clarity and maintainability. Credentials are managed
# securely via a separate `credentials.json` file.
